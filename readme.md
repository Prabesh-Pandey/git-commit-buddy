WORKING STATE: secrets removed.

An API key was present here and has been removed and backed up to `readme.md.bak`.
If that key was valid, rotate/revoke it immediately and store secrets in a secure place (machine-local settings or environment variables).

Notes:

- Backup: readme.md.bak
- Next step: run the command palette → "Git AutoPush: Set AI API Key (machine-local)" or set `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` in the environment that launches VS Code.
